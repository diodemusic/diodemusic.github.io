    <h1>Habitat</h1>
    <p>
        Frogs thrive in a large number of environments from tropical forests to frozen tundras to deserts. Their skin requires freshwater, so most frogs live in aquatic and swampy habitats.

    <p>
        Common frogs can be found anywhere that is damp enough and has a pond or other body of water nearby. 
        Gardens are a key habitat, but regular sightings reported for the RSPB's garden wildlife survey fell by 17% between 2014 and 2018.
